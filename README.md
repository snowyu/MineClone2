# MineClone2
An unofficial Minecraft-like game for Minetest. Forked from MineClone by davedevils.
Developed by many people. Not developed or endorsed by Mojang AB.

Version: 0.75 (in development)

### Gameplay
You start in a randomly-generated world made entirely of cubes. You can explore
the world and dig and build almost every block in the world to create new
structures. You can choose to play in a “survival mode” in which you have to
fight monsters and hunger for survival and slowly progress through the
various other aspects of the game, such as mining, farming, building machines, and so on
Or you can play in “creative mode” in which you can build almost anything instantly.

#### Gameplay summary

* Sandbox-style gameplay, no goals
* Survive: Fight against hostile monsters and hunger
* Mine for ores and other treasures
* Magic: Gain experience and enchant your tools
* Use the collected blocks to create great buildings, your imagination is the limit
* Collect flowers (and other dye sources) and colorize your world
* Find some seeds and start farming
* Find or craft one of hundreds of items
* Build a railway system and have fun with minecarts
* Build complex machines with redstone circuits
* In creative mode you can build almost anything for free and without limits

## How to play (quick start)
### Getting started
* **Punch a tree** trunk until it breaks and collect wood
* Place the **wood into the 2×2 grid** (your “crafting grid” in your inventory menu and craft 4 wood planks
* Place the 4 wood planks in a 2×2 shape in the crafting grid to **make a crafting table**
* **Rightclick the crafting table** for a 3×3 crafting grid to craft more complex things
* Use the **crafting guide** (book icon) to learn all the possible crafting recipes
* **Craft a wooden pickaxe** so you can dig stone
* Different tools break different kinds of blocks. Try them out!
* Continue playing as you wish. Have fun!

### Farming
* Find seeds
* Craft hoe
* Rightclick dirt or similar block with hoe to create farmland
* Place seeds on farmland and watch them grow
* Collect plant when fully grown
* If near water, farmland becomes wet and speeds up growth

### Furnace
* Craft furnace
* Furnace allows you to obtain more items
* Upper slot must contain a smeltable item (example: iron ore)
* Lower slot must contain a fuel item (example: coal)
* See tooltips in crafting guide to learn about fuels and smeltable items

### Additional help
More help about the gameplay, blocks items and much more can be found from inside
the game. You can access the help from your inventory menu.

### Special items
The following items are interesting for Creative Mode and for adventure
map builders. They can not be obtained in-game or in the creative inventory.

* Barrier: `mcl_core:barrier`

Use the `/giveme` chat command to obtain them. See the in-game help for
an explanation.

## Installation
This game requires [Minetest](http://minetest.net) to run (version 5.4.1 or
later). So you need to install Minetest first. Only stable versions of Minetest
are officially supported.
There is no support for running MineClone2 in development versions of Minetest.

To install MineClone2 (if you haven't already), move this directory into the
“games” directory of your Minetest data directory. Consult the help of
Minetest to learn more.

## Target
- Crucially, create a stable, moddable, free/libre clone of Minecraft
based on the Minetest engine with polished features, usable in both
singleplayer and multiplayer. Currently, most of **Minecraft Java
Edition 1.12.2** features are already implemented and polishing existing
features are prioritized over new feature requests.
- With lessened priority yet strictly, implement features targetting
**Minecraft version 1.17 + OptiFine** (OptiFine only as far as supported
by the Minetest Engine). This means features in parity with the listed
Minecraft experiences are prioritized over those that don't fulfill this
scope.
- Optionally, create a performant experience that will run relatively
well on really low spec computers. Unfortunately, due to Minecraft's
mechanisms and Minetest engine's limitations along with a very small
playerbase on low spec computers, optimizations are hard to investigate.

## Completion status
This game is currently in **beta** stage.
It is playable, but not yet feature-complete.
Backwards-compability is not entirely guaranteed, updating your world might cause small bugs.
If you want to use the git version of MineClone2 in production, consider using the production branch.
It is updated weekly and contains relatively stable code for servers.

The following main features are available:

* Tools, weapons
* Armor
* Crafting system: 2×2 grid, crafting table (3×3 grid), furnace, including a crafting guide

Technical differences from Minecraft:

* Height limit of ca. 31000 blocks (much higher than in Minecraft)
* Horizontal world size is ca. 62000×62000 blocks (much smaller than in Minecraft, but it is still very large)
* Still very incomplete and buggy
* Blocks, items, enemies and other features are missing
* A few items have slightly different names to make them easier to distinguish
* Different music for jukebox
* Different textures (Pixel Perfection)
* Different sounds (various sources)
* Different engine (Minetest)
