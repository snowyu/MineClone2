Cauldrons are used to store water and slowly fill up under rain. They can also be used to wash off banners.=
Place a water bucket into the cauldron to fill it with water. Place an empty bucket on a full cauldron to retrieve the water. Place a water bottle into the cauldron to fill the cauldron to one third with water. Place a glass bottle in a cauldron with water to retrieve one third of the water. Use an emblazoned banner on a cauldron with water to wash off its top layer.=
