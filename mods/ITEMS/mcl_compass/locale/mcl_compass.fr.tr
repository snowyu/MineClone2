Compass=Boussole
Points to the world origin=Pointe vers l'origine mondiale
Compasses are tools which point to the world origin (X@=0, Z@=0) or the spawn point in the Overworld.=Les boussoles sont des outils qui pointent vers l'origine du monde (X@=0,Z@=0) ou le point d'apparition dans l'Overworld.
A Compass always points to the world spawn point when the player is in the overworld.  In other dimensions, it spins randomly.=
Lodestone Compass=
Points to a lodestone=
Lodestone compasses resemble regular compasses, but they point to a specific lodestone.=
A Lodestone compass can be made from an ordinary compass by using it on a lodestone.  After becoming a lodestone compass, it always points to its linked lodestone, provided that they are in the same dimension.  If not in the same dimension, the lodestone compass spins randomly, similarly to a regular compass when outside the overworld.  A lodestone compass can be relinked with another lodestone.=
