Mob Spawner=生怪砖
A mob spawner regularily causes mobs to appear around it while a player is nearby. Some mob spawners are disabled while in light.=
If you have a spawn egg, you can use it to change the mob to spawn. Just place the item on the mob spawner. Player-set mob spawners always spawn mobs regardless of the light level.=当玩家在附近时，生怪砖会定期导致生物出现在其周围。有些生怪砖在光照下会被禁用。
